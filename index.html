            <p>Machine objects have two modes: dormant and active. I am interested
              in the transformation of the object form one state to the other and in
              particular, the moments in between.  Within the context of jewellery,
              my work aims to demonstrate this mechanical dance – the opening,
              unfurling and reveal – by engaging the wearer in this process of discovery.
              The wearer is invited to examine the action and tactility of the piece,
              giving it time and attention prior to placement on the body. It is hoped
              that this interaction will aid in the generation of a relationship between
              person and jewellery object.</p>

            <p>"Vessels and containers are an innate method of communication.
              They convey a story of gathering, holding, storing – not only do
              they surround us in our daily lives, they shape our perception of
              the division between inside and out, the notion of moving from one
              framed space into another. The practice of making vessels enables me
              to work both with metal and space as materials, thereby redefining
              these borders. I explore the morphological qualities of vessels
              and the process of embedding objects from the domestic landscape with
              spirit. My work communicates through its sensory qualities and invites
              the observer to pick it up or look closely before revealing its story.""</p>

            <p>“I aim to walk that fine line between making something simple enough
               that one unavoidably recognizes, that simultaneously requires a fair
               conscious effort to get beyond the obvious, and at the same time to
               be abstract enough that it allows a shift to happen, that the piece
               becomes something altogether new when it unpredictably connects with
               you.”
